#YCMatrix

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/yconst/YCMatrix.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/yconst/YCMatrix)
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/20003/yconst/YCMatrix.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/20003/yconst/YCMatrix)
[![Carthage compatible](https://img.shields.io/badge/Carthage-compatible-4BC51D.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)

A flexible Matrix library for Objective-C and Swift, that interfaces 
BLAS, LAPACK and vDSP functions via the Accelerate Framework.

YCMatrix is available for MacOS (10.7+), as well as iOS (8.0+).

##Getting started

### Adding the framework to your project

Import the project in your workspace, or open the framework project in XCode, build and import the product.

.. or alternatively, just drag+drop the files (.h and .m) that you want to your project, presto.

### Importing

YCMatrix defines a module so in newer versions of XCode, 
 you can simply import the framework with:

    @include YCMatrix;

Alternatively, you can do:

    #import "YCMatrix/YCMatrix.h"

### Dependencies

YCMatrix has no dependencies other than system 
frameworks (namely Foundation.framework and Accelerate.framework). 

### Importing/Using with CocoaPods (no longer supported)

Unfortunately Cocoapods is no longer supported as of 0.6.8. The decision to end Cocoapods support is related to the increasing time needed for debugging related to Cocoapods support (e.g. Xcode/OS updates, addition of C++ etc.). Dropping Cocoapods support will allow for more time spent to developing the project. We recommend Carthage for managing your project's dependencies. You may easily include YCMatrix in your cartfile as follows:

    github "yconst/YCMatrix"

In addition, YCMatrix can be easily included manually into an Xcode project, by copying header and implementation files (and optionally creating a new target). 

## Usage

### Naming Conventions

Methods that result in a new Matrix instance are usually prefixed with "matrixFrom",
e.g. -matrixFromSubtraction: . Methods that change the receiver in-place
do not have the prefix. In some cases, such as matrix-matrix multiplication,
the prefix is not included in the method name, even though it is obvious that
the result of the operation is a new Matrix instance.

### Example

The snippet below is a basic example of matrix multiplication. 
It also shows how you can easily create matrices with predefined 
values.

    @include YCMatrix;
    
    Matrix *I = [Matrix identityOfRows:3 columns:3]; // 3x3 Identity
    Matrix *C = [Matrix matrixOfRows:3 columns:3 value:2]; // 3x3 filled with 2s
    Matrix *S = [I matrixByAddition:C]; // Outputs a new matrix
    NSLog(@"Result:\n%@", S);
    
    // Result:
    // 3.0  2.0  2.0
    // 2.0  3.0  2.0
    // 2.0  2.0  3.0
    
##What's in there?

The Framework functionality is split into four files: The base class
definition, and three categories:

- Matrix.h                : YCMatrix class definition and basic operations.
- Matrix+Advanced.h       : Interface to more advanced LAPACK functions.
- Matrix+Manipulate.h     : Functions for manipulating rows/columns etc.
- Matrix+Map.h            : Functions for linearly mapping matrices.

In addition, there is a file that implements functionality related to NSArrays containing Matrices.

Please refer to the [docs](http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/YCMatrix/) for a complete overview of the functionality 
contained in each of the categories.

In addition, YCMatrix comes with many unit tests included. Tests are divided in six files:

- YCMatrixTests           : General Matrix-related tests.
- YCMatrixAdvancedTests   : Tests related to higher-level operations (decompositions, inverses etc.).
- YCMatrixManipulateTests : Tests related to matrix manipulation operations.
- YCMatrixMapTests        : Tests related to linear mapping operations.
- YCMatrixNSArrayTests    : Tests related to NSArray categories.
- YCMatrixPerformanceTests: Tests for measuring performance of various operations.

##Performance

YCMatrix has been built from the ground up with performance in mind. vDSP, BLAS and LAPACK are being used extensively throughout the framework. In addition, care has been given in memory allocation during initialization and copying.

The test file YCMatrixPerformanceTests.m contains some benchmarks using different addition/subtraction implementations (vDSP, BLAS, and pure C).
