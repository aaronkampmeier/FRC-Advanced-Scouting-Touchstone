<p>A FIRST FRC Scouting iOS Application</p>
<p>FAST is a modern scouting and event information application for the FIRST Robotics Competition. It enables all the scouts and strategists on your team to easily access all of your team’s data. Scouted data and match information is transmitted seamlessly from the stands straight to the pit so your team can make actionable decisions about gameplay strategy and alliance selection and, most importantly, win!</p>
<p>Never deal with loads and loads of paper scouting sheets or complex, hard-to-manage custom computer scouting systems ever again. FAST is easy enough for a rookie team to get started with, yet powerful enough to support the data needs of a large, world-class team.</p>
<p>FAST supports easy adding of the event you are attending using The Blue Alliance’s database seamlessly in the background. FAST simply pulls down all event data including team and match information, match scores, match times, and more. All data is presented in a clean and concise manner centering around the teams attending.</p>
<p>FAST puts making actionable decisions for team picking first. Everyone on your team can use their own device to scout teams and matches, update information and notes, and easily visualize stats using informative graphs and team sorting. </p>

<p>If you would like to help improve FAST, there are a number of ways to contribute. If you have any suggestions or issues, email me at <a href="mailto:frcfastapp@gmail.com">frcfastapp@gmail.com</a> or create a GitHub issue in the repo. If you would like to help develop out the mobile iOS app, fork this repo and create PRs with changes you want implemented. </p>
<p>Many users would also love an Android and/or Web client for FAST as well. While I think this is a great idea, I don&#39;t have the resources to create them. If you would like to work on developing out clients for those platforms that still work with FAST&#39;s scouted data, contact me, and we can work together.</p>
